  position_sizing:
    type: fixed         # fixed | percentage | monetary
    value: 0.5          # Depends on type:
                        #   fixed: lots per trade (e.g., 0.5 = 0.5 lots)
                        #   percentage: % of account (e.g., 1.0 = 1% of balance)
                        #   monetary: $ amount to risk (e.g., 100.0 = $100 per trade)

                        #   monetary: $ amount (e.g., 500.0 = $500 risk)
                        #   atr: multiplier (e.g., 1.5 = 1.5x ATR)
                        #   percentage: % of entry (e.g., 2.0 = 2%)

  # Take Profit

  tp:
    # Option 1: Single Target
    # type: fixed         # fixed | monetary | rr (risk:reward)
    # value: 1000.0       # Depends on type:
    #                     #   fixed: pips (e.g., 200.0 = 200 pips)
    #                     #   monetary: $ amount (e.g., 1000.0 = $1000 profit)
    #                     #   rr: ratio (e.g., 2.0 = 2:1 risk:reward)

    # Option 2: Multiple Targets (scaling out)
    type: multi_target
    targets:
      - value: 1.0        # 1:1 R:R
        percent: 50       # Close 50% of position
        move_stop: true   # Move SL to breakeven after hitting this target
      - value: 2.0        # 2:1 R:R
        percent: 50       # Close remaining 50%
        move_stop: false

# ============================================================================
# OPTIONAL: Position Scaling
# ============================================================================
# Uncomment to enable position scaling (multiple entries)
# If not specified, uses the default scaling from broker config
#
# scaling:
#   enabled: true
#   num_entries: 2          # Number of separate entries
#   distribution: [60, 40]  # % of total position per entry
#                           # Must sum to 100
#
# Example: If position_sizing.value = 1.0 lot and num_entries = 2:
#   Entry 1: 0.6 lots (60%)
#   Entry 2: 0.4 lots (40%)
